We will have an interacting presentation showing the interaction between
Python and PostgreSQL using psycopg2, the most used Postgres database driver
for Python.

We will touch basic topics: the basic Python objects, interaction with a
database session, data adaptation, security by avoiding SQL injections.

The speaker is Daniele Varrazzo: free software developer, Python and
PostgreSQL enthusiast, psycopg2 maintainer.
